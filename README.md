## General Information

This project is based on Arduino and was inspired by the FORBOT course as well as the Arduino blink sketch found at the following links:
- [FORBOT Arduino Course](https://forbot.pl/blog/kurs-arduino-srodowisko-jak-zaczac-programowac-id936)
- [Arduino Blink Example](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/Blink)

The code is implemented using object-oriented programming techniques and serves as an introduction to embedded systems development.

## Technologies Used

- PlatformIO IDE v3.1.1
- Framework-arduino-avr @ 5.1.0

## Features

- Blinks the built-in LED on the Arduino board.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO IDE installed on your computer.
2. Connect your Arduino-compatible board (e.g., Arduino UNO, Arduino Nano, ESP32) to your computer.
3. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Niewiaro/Blinking-LED_BUILTIN-OOP.git`
4. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
5. Compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage
